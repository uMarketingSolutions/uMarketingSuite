# uMarketingSuite
The complete marketing toolbox for Umbraco projects.

More details about the package can be found on the website: https://www.umarketingsuite.com/. 

Discussions and questions can be asked here: https://our.umbraco.com/packages/backoffice-extensions/umarketingsuite-the-all-in-one-marketingsuite-for-umbraco/feedback/

GitHub is used for public issue tracking at the moment. We will have our internal tooling to create our sprints, but will look at open issues in the issuetracker and update the issues over here.

Happy testing!

The team of the uMarketingSuite
